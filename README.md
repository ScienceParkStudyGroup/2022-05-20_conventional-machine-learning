# Conventional Machine Learning 

Workshop on Machine Learning organised at the Data Science Center on 20 May 2022. 

# Conventional Machine Learning

In the past decade, Deep Learning, originally a subfield of Machine Learning, has gained considerable influence and momentum. 
In order to distinguish "traditional" Machine Learning such as Random Forest or Regularised Regression from Deep Learning models, we decided to coin this workshop _"conventional Machine Learning"_.

__Note:__ Machine Learning is often abbreviated in ML. 

## Learning objectives

1) Get familiarised with Machine Learning terminology and terms. 
2) Learn about automated Machine Learning: choosing the best ML model 
3)
